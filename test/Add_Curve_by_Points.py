# This script shows an example of how a path curve can be added to a RoboDK station.
# The curve can be optionally projected to an existing object (either along the curve normals or to the closes distance)
#
# projection types (for AddCurve, as defined in robodk.robolink):
#PROJECTION_NONE                = 0 # No curve projection
#PROJECTION_CLOSEST             = 1 # The projection will the closest point on the surface
#PROJECTION_ALONG_NORMAL        = 2 # The projection will be done along the normal.
#PROJECTION_ALONG_NORMAL_RECALC = 3 # The projection will be done along the normal. Furthermore, the normal will be recalculated according to the surface normal.
